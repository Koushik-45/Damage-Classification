A comprehensive bridge deck evaluation requires the detection of surface and sub-surface defects. Supervised deep learning networks, such as convolution neural networks (CNNs), which requires ground truth for validation, have yielded the most promising results among the AI methods for bridge deck evaluation due to their high accuracy
